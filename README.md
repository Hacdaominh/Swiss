# Swisstronik Testnet 2.0

We provide 6 scripts used for 6 task in this testnet program. We wil ensure that our code base is `safe` and does not any malicious line code in it.

We also support the export data result for your task answer. When you run each script, automatically generating the JSON file included result (`task1.json`, `task2.json`, `task3.json`, `task4.json`, `task5.json`,) in the `root` direction.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm install
```

Run each of task with corresponding script name (`Task1.js`, `Task2.js`, `Task3.js`, `Task4.js`, `Task5.js`)

```shell
npx hardhat run ignition/modules/Task1.js --network swisstronik

npx hardhat run ignition/modules/Task2.js --network swisstronik

npx hardhat run ignition/modules/Task3.js --network swisstronik

npx hardhat run ignition/modules/Task4.js --network swisstronik

npx hardhat run ignition/modules/Task5.js --network swisstronik
```

**Note:** Task 5 & Task 6 is not available now because the explorer is not finished indexing and we can not verify the contract. Keep calm until it will be finished. Devs are working hard. Good Luck you, guys !!!
